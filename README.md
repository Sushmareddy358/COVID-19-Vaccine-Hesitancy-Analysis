### COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: County and Local Estimates in the US

This project analyzes CDC county-level data to explore geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across the United States. Using Python and Tableau, the analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizations to identify regional trends and drivers of hesitancy. Key findings highlight the impact of social vulnerability, access barriers, and misinformation on vaccine acceptance. The project proposes targeted, evidence-based strategies—such as expanding vaccine access, combatting misinformation, and engaging community leaders—to improve vaccine uptake.
